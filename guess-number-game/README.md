# Guess Number Game: Monad Transformer Practice.

This project is just  personal practice for "Monad Transformer" concept in haskell.

## Game Rule

1. supoose we have two player: Player1 and Player2, they take turn guess the random generate number.
1. if one guess wrong answer, then output "greater then answer" or "less then answer" base on it's value.
1. each palyer can only guess one time, then take turn to another player.
1. if anyone guuess the correct answer, then the program over.

## Concept need to familar 

1. Monad: IO monad, do notation, etc.
1. State Monad
1. StateT: Monad Transformer concept
